description: Complete demonstration script for selecting and installing applications
---

This is a demonstration script written in python that that highlights a number of Dialogs abilities:

 - Using SF Symbols as an icon with custom colours
 - Requesting the user for input via a number of checkboxes
 - Updating the message area with progress text and status provided by emoji using a command file
 - incrementing a progress bar
 - disabling the default button until the process is complete
 - blurring the display behind the dialog, preventing user input into other applications

There are likely a number of optimisations that could be made if this were to be used as a basis for a production workflow.

## How it works

The script keep track of an array of items to install and the command used to trigger the install and uses this array to present a list of checkboxes. Based on what was selected, another array is created for the presentation. As each item is processed the presentation array is updated with the current state and then sent to the command file which dialog uses to update its display. The progress bar is then incremented

* **_No actual processing is taking place in this script. The code is written to give the impression that activity is taking place for demonstration purposes_**
