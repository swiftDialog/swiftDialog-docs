There are none.

Dialog was made to be as simple as possible. Anything that is configurable is done so with command line options, which is the primary method of interaction.

Nor is there any logic other than what is required to display the dialog.

The intention is that you, as the admin deploying this tool, would write any logic for calling and dealing with the result in your scripting language of choice.
