## swiftDialog Construction Kit (Alpha state)

swiftDialog includes a new `--builder` command. When called, an additional window is shown allowing you to update content and dialog properties and see the results in real time.

You can then generate JSON that can be used to re-create the dialog as you designed it

** NOTE - This feature is not yet 100% complete and some settings are not available or will not appear in the generated JSON. Development is ongoing **
