description: How to keep swiftDialog up to date
---

Dialog does not have a built in update function.

To keep dialog up to date there are a number of options though

## PKG Installer or zip file.

The simplest method is to download the PKG or ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog-public/releases) manually and install directly or import into your management tool of choice.

## Installomator

Version 0.7 of [Installomator](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator) includes a label for Dialog.

To install dialog using Installomator, simply download and run `./Installomator.sh dialog` or import the Installomator script into you management too of choice.
